    <string name="about_company">Buses go almost everywhere in India and are the only way to get around many mountainous areas.
    They tend to be the cheapest way to travel. Services are fast and frequent.
    Roads in mountainous or curvy terrain can be perilous; buses are often driven with wilful abandon, and accidents are always a risk.
Avoid night buses unless thereâ€™s no alternative: driving conditions are more hazardous and drivers may be inebriated or overtired.

All buses make snack and toilet stops (some more frequently than others), providing a break but possibly adding hours to journey times.
Shared jeeps complement the bus service in many mountain areas.</string>
